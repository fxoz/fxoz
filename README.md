## Hi there!

I am Felix Orosz, an 18-year-old computer science student from Germany. My interests include almost everything related to tech—programming, photography, video editing, PC components, and more.

Since 2022, I have worked several times at _VDEh-Betriebsforschungsinstitut GmbH_ as a full-stack web developer, primarily during my school vacations.

### Childhood

- From a very early age, I was fascinated by computers and technology.
- As a child, I loved recording and editing videos using _Avidemux_ and _VideoPad_. At one point, I even wanted to become a cameraman when I grew up.
- I grew up using _Linux Mint_ and _Windows XP_, both of which significantly influenced my interest in technology.
- In primary school, a friend introduced me to [_Scratch_](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ikuch/), a simple block-based programming language. I started developing basic 2D games, which quickly became a hobby.
- Additionally, I enjoyed creating and editing videos for YouTube, regularly uploading entertainment and gaming-related content to several channels. This hobby eventually faded away.

### 2020: Started Programming with Python

- While I had been using GitHub since 2017, I consider 2020 the year I became an active and enthusiastic programmer, largely due to the [COVID-19 lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany).
- I started learning Python with [this book](https://www.amazon.de/Programmieren-supereasy-Einfacher-Einstieg-SCRATCH/dp/3831027005) and still enjoy working with the language today.
- I collaborated with small to medium-sized Discord communities to develop helpful bots for server administration and management. This sparked my interest in application programming interfaces (APIs).

### 2022: Student Internship at BFI

- As part of a student internship, I developed a dashboard for an internal project at [VDEh-Betriebsforschungsinstitut GmbH](https://www.bfi.de/en/).

### 2023: _"Kreathon"_ Contest

_As stated on [the website](https://archive.ph/1aWPa):_

> Krefeld's fourth major hackathon event, [Kreathon 2023], aims to make the world more convenient and, above all, more sustainable. SWK, Fressnapf, and the Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences are providing a total of six challenges this year.

Simply put, you and your team choose one of several assignments and have 24 hours to develop a solution and prepare a presentation.

Our team chose the challenge "Life Cycle Assessment of Sustainable Packaging." We developed an app that allows users to scan a product and evaluate its eco-friendliness. The code can be found at [https://github.com/kreathon23](https://github.com/kreathon23).

### 2024: High School Diploma (_Abitur_)

- In 2024, I successfully graduated from grammar school (_Gymnasium_).
- During my studies, I received an exclusive certificate from the [_Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V._](https://gi.de/) for my "herausragenden Leistungen im Fach Informatik" (_Outstanding Achievements in Computer Science_).

### 2024–Present: Studying Computer Science

- Since autumn 2024, I have been studying computer science (_Informatik_) at the _Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences_ (**HSNR**) in Krefeld, North Rhine-Westphalia.
- My team and I participated in a robotics competition and placed 7th out of 85 teams. Details, the code, and a video can be found at [https://github.com/fxoz/esp](https://github.com/fxoz/esp).
